# Algorithms to use:

1. DBScan Clustering
2. K means
3. Isolation forest
4. Local outlier factor
5. One class SVM


### 1: DBScan 
A density-based anomaly detection method.


### 3: Isolation forest
This algorithm works great with very high dimensional datasets



# Steps
1. EDA
2. Log transform skewed distributions
2. Standardize data
3. Create PCA
4. Visualize with PCA


# Definitions
- An outlier is an observation with at least one variable having an unusual value.
- A univariate outlier is an observation with a variable that has an unusual value.
- A multivariate outlier is an observation with at least two variables having unusual values.
